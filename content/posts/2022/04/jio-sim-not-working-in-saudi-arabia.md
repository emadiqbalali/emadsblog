Is your Jio sim not working in Saudi Arabia? Are you facing a "No Network" issue on Jio sim outside India? Did you forget to recharge the sim card with the roaming package before going on a vacation?

Don't worry, you're in the right place. I have a quick and effective solution for this problem and it's not going to take much time.

Usually, sim providers like Airtel & Vodafone don't have this problem as they self-register even without the roaming package activated within India.

However, Jio especially if the sim is never recharged with the **International Roaming** package then you will never get the network when you land there and even recharging with the International Roaming package doesn't work since you're without a network in another country.

**Also, you don't need to recharge with any International Roaming package if you're planning to use the SIM for only OTP and SMS purposes.** You will get the network without recharging.

## How To Fix No Network Issue Jio In Saudi Arabia, UAE and other countries?

There are simple steps you need to follow to get your sim up and working. Follow these steps to get your Jio sim card working outside India

- As soon as you're connected with the Executive, explain to them the whole issue and ask them to activate the network as you forgot to recharge Internation Roaming Package. They will verify if you're really the owner of the SIM card.  
    P.S: You don't need to recharge to get a network.  
    
- Now for verification purposes, make sure you have Aadhar Card on which the sim is registered. **You will be asked for the last 4 digits of your Aadhar card.**  
    
- You'll also be asked for your **Father's Name** as per the Aadhar you used while registering the SIM card  
    
- Next, you will then be asked for the **Device** in which the first Jio Sim was inserted  
    
- That's it. After verification, they will tell you to restart the device within 15 minutes and you will get your network up and running.

## Wrapping Up

Jio sim not working in Saudi Arabia is a common issue everyone faces especially if they don't recharge it with International Roaming before stepping out. However, if you don't want to spend Rs 600-1100 on the International Roaming package then this is also the way to activate the sim for Roaming before going on the vacation.

If it works for you, then don't forget to share it with your friends and family.
