9\. Set up your timezone. Time zone appears only according to the country you selected in step 2. In my case it's United States so the following timezone appears.

10\. Now the installer will scan your disk and provides you with four options. Hence we use the entire disk and not going to configure the LVM (Logical volume Disk). We gonna choose the \[Guided - Use Entire Disk\]. Experienced users can have manual partitioning method.

11\. Next step promotes you to choose the disk you want to be partitioned.

12\. Now, you can keep all the file in single partition the default one or can use the other option provided below it. However, If you don't know you can choose the default one.

13\. Now you will get the last chance to reveal all the changes made to your disk before it makes the changes to disk.

14\. Configure the network mirrors here. Note that if you choose 'NO' you can't install packages from Kali repository later.

15\. Now this step is important as it install GRUB loader. Somehow you must not listen this word before if you're not much familiar with installing and dual booting windows or linux.

GRUB Loader will list all the operating systems in your computer to select the one you wished to open!

16\. Finally, it's over. Installation has completed! Reboot to enjoy the Kali!
