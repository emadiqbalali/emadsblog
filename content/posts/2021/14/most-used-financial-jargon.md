Well, atleast I can try to to explain the few jargon here and there to get you the better understanding of this unique finance world.

Practically, not all jargon you're used to hearing daily unless you're really from a Finance background. Since I also don't belong there and I will only mention those usually used words often.

## Top Financial Jargon You Might Never Heard of

1. **Stocks**  
      
    Stocks are nothing but the shares of a company. When you own stocks/shares, you're basically a part of the company and bear its losses and profits.

    **For Ex:** You own a piece of land in India, this piece of land is your asset. In short, what you have or own is your assets.  
    
3. **Liability**  
      
    Liability on the other hand is the complete opposite of assets. In short, liability is something you owe i.e, money, goods, etc.  
    **For Ex:** You have a loan or EMI taken from a bank, the remaining money is a liability for you.  
    
4. **Balance Sheet**
