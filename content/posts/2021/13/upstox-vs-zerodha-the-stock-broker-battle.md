To enter into the world of Stock Market, we need access to **Broker.** You cannot directly go in and buy the shares of the company, isn't it?

Well, there comes a trick. You also need to be sure that your broker isn't trying to steal money from you and mostly reliable enough to help you trade smoothly. I'm writing this article to help you with selecting your **Stock Broker**.

If you need to skip the basics and get right away with the Stock Broker Battle: Upstox vs Zerodha then [click here.](#battle)

## Why Do I Need A Broker?

Exaclty, right! Why do I need one?

Well, broker is someone that helps you buy and sell shares in the market since you can't access the market directly.

Let me give you an example of **Real Estate.** You wanted to buy a house and since you don't know anything about the **Real Estate** Market, how exactly will you be able to find a potential seller and get yourself a house?

Even though you have a potential seller, but you lack knowledge, you don't know the paper works involved, procedures involved, and there's a lot of hassles.

Therefore, you need a middleman to handle all such issues for a small commission which makes your work of buying and selling a piece of cake. The middleman is known as **Agent/Broker.**

Similarly, Broker is the same middleman from the above example. Moreever, there are certain rules, and only brokers have access to the direct market.

There's a lot lot more stuff going on behind the scenes of your simple **BUY & SELL** button.

## What Do Stock Market Brokers Do?

Well, pretty simple. For now, let's discuss this a bit, and if you want to skip to the point, i.e, Upstox vs Zerodha charges click [here](#battle).

They help you to participate in stock market and allows you to buy the shares of particular company listed on the exchanges.

However, to be honest, broker does a lot more work for you, like for example

- Brokers help you place orders (i.e, buy or sell) and provide you with very easy terminals to do this.
- Brokers provide you with trading account and a DEMAT account.
- Stock Market brokers provides you with great charting tools.
- They provide you with a system to manage your risks and enable you to track your portfolio over time.

## Do Stock Brokers Charge A Lot?

No.

There might be some out there in the past in your experience but for me, there weren't any brokers who charged me a lot.

**There are two types of Brokers out there.**

1. **Full-Service** Brokers  
      
    This type of broker initially helps you out with everything and has great customer service. They provide you with Analysis, Support and usually charge a lot more for all these services.  
      
    Like all brokers, they provide you with Trading Account as well as DEMAT but at a high cost.  
    The maintenance charges of the DEMAT account is very high as well.  
      
    Ex: **ICICI Direct, Kotak Securities**  
    
2. **Discount Brokers**  
      
    These brokers are discounted brokers. They don't provide you anything other than the Trading and DEMAT account. Therefore, they are discounted.  
      
    They usually charge very little or offer free account opening. They have low maintenance charges for the DEMAT account. Moreover, they do help you if you reach them out if you encounter problems with their terminal but not with your regular stock problems.  
    

Let's quickly get to the point**, the battle of discount brokers: Upstox vs Zerodha**.

## Upstox vs Zerodha: Which One Is The Best?

The Battle starts now! Let me tell you first of all that both of these brokers are **Discount Brokers.**

I hope you got the better insights of both brokers. The basic difference in between them. That's not it. While in use, there are certain things you should be knowing in depth.

## In-Depth Insights of Upstox Broker

Meanwhile, Upstox is overall a good broker. They are opening your account for free and even offer you 30 days of no brokerage fee benefits.

The downside to this is that you stick with them a bit in your early days, however, you won't be able to stick with them for long. I don't recommend using Upstox for now, for intraday trading especially in volatile markets**.**

The Upstox Demat Transaction charges are also on the higher side which is Rs 18.5 + GST i.e, Rs 21.5.

Moreover, you get 5 watchlists with 100 scrips per watchlist which is pretty amazing.

Upstox went down several times in a row due to some issues, and it might again. I know they are improving but still, you can't just risk a lot of money for their glitch.

Behind the scenes of Upstox Servers when **market is completely very volatile.**

I have a Upstox account solely for holding my trades and for the positional trades. I am not a big fan of their back-office but it works for me. The console Upstox is called Back office in Upstox and they worked a lot on their Back office and it is very good now compared to old ones.

It's messy and not easily accessible to get your tradebook, reports, etc like Zerodha offers full aesthetic looks in their so called "Console".

Upstox is a basic brokerage and they do charge more on the debit but above all, they let you open an account for free. If you're a beginner and want to invest, go for Upstox.

## In-Depth Insights of Zerodha

Zerodha is a very versatile discount broker. They have amazing platform for trading and everything is setup amazingly well. Ofcourse, the Rs 200 doesn't matter to pay for me.

Inside the platform, everything is well fitted. However, Zerodha have 5 watchlists and all of them is capable of holding 50 scrips only.

They have good report section or say Back Office for your trades, P&L statements, etc. They also have good things like 60-Days Trading Challenges.

They are quick and as far as I know, in my experience of last 1 year, they never went down. The customer service responds quickly.

If you're a heavy trader and often do Intraday in stocks and options, then **ZERODHA** is for you.

## Wrapping Up

According to my, both of them are great in their own respective ways. If you don't want to spend money on the opening charges, go for Upstox, and remember, you can do intraday, but it can sometimes be glitchy.

While on the other hand, Zerodha is close to perfection. They have an amazing console which I like the most, the trade buying and selling is amazing as well.

In the end, I hope you know the battle between Upstox vs Zerodha and the one who won for you, go with it. I personally have both of them right now.
