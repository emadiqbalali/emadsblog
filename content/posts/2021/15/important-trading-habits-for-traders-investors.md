## Very Important Trading Rules & Habits You Should Learn And Apply To Remain Profitable

### 1\. Your Winning Trading System Should Be Designed Uniquely

There is no one ever perfect in the market to get all the 100% accuracy in their trading. Yes, everyone no matter how experienced they are still tends to make losses in the market.

Therefore, we need to make our setup of trading in such a way that, your **losses** should be there but not more than the **profits**. In short, cut your losing trades faster and hold your winning trades longer. Stick to your analysis and if it went wrong in any way, cut the trade immediately while holding the trade with trailing stop loss if the trade went right.

In the end, you will be profitable in the long term since you will have more overall profits than overall losses. Take a look below at the **risk: reward ratio and the** required win rate for profitability.

**A 1:1 risk/reward ratio requires a greater than 50% win rate for profitability.  
A 1:2 risk/reward ratio requires a greater than 33% win rate for profitability.  
A 1:3 risk/reward ratio requires a greater than 25% win rate for profitability.  
A 1:5 risk/reward ratio requires a greater than 17% win rate for profitability.**

### 2\. Your Analysis & Trade Should Be On Pure Facts Instead of Your Own Opinions

Never ever do this. If you're beginner traders, you will do this 95% of the time. You will satisfy yourself on why this stock will eventually go up by making your own stories or you might hear of someone speaking about it on TV Channels.

**You need to get the facts right.** On what facts exactly, you're trading the particular stock? What is your Analysis?

If you've got the specific reason why you're entering the stock will give you a higher winning percentage. You can work on many strategies available, like the **Simple Breakouts, Support & Resistance, etc.**

It is a lot better than trading on the basis of beliefs, a feeling, or just a mere prediction. Therefore, you need to gather up yourself, spend more time on drawing trend lines, watching breakouts with volume, backtesting each and everything.

Over time, you will be able to develop the skills of identifying the stocks very easily and trade on them with facts and all odds in your favor giving you a good winning rate.

### 3\. Always Work With Trend & Avoid Trading Against The Trend

The trend is always determined on the particular time frame. If someone asks you "What's the trend?", you just need to ask them back "What's your Time Frame?". Hope you got an idea here.

No matter what, **try to capture the trend on your own investing or trading time frame.** A person whose time frame is 15 Minutes and his trend is uptrend while your time frame of 1 day doesn't necessarily mean your trend is also an uptrend.

So, remember to always capture the trend in your time frame. You can easily use the **Simple Moving Average** to find out the trend or simply [draw trend lines](https://sastaeinstein.com/stock-market-psychology/) on your time frame.

Always work with trend in your time frame despite it is different for different time frames.

### 4\. The Bear Markets Have No Long Term Support & The Bull Markets Have No Long Term Resistance

It is what it is. When the rally starts, there is no such thing as long-term resistance, the bull market repeatedly gives breakouts to 52 weeks high and then to an all-time high, and short-sellers get hurt during the bullish condition because resistance no longer holds back the increasing price.

Resistance is broken and broken, short-sellers are forced to cover their positions. In the Bull market, buying is eventually rewarded. Buying dips give traders and investors the chance to catch the next trip to all-time highs.

While the same happens in the bear market. During the 20% fall, panic covers up, weak hands get washed out and all **key support levels are lost.**

Stop losses are triggered and all rallies are sold into, and a down-trending market shakes many of the holders who prepare to buy after the downtrend ends. In a bearish market, the dips are no more bought into and are replaced by further dips until the selling is exhausted.

Now the signs of exhaustion start with Consolidation where accumulation continues and many will pick up the bottom of the market.

By this rule, you know and understand why you should cut the wrong trades faster and hold the correct trades for longer.

### 5\. The Bigger The Market Gaps, More Likely The Trend Will Continue

I am sure, you've seen the Gaps in the market. When the market is trending and bullish, there are almost big gaps every day seen in the Market. This simply means that it is most likely that the trend will continue assuming that the market gaps are becoming larger over time.

If we see the other side, it's the same for the trending and bearish market. The larger the market gaps downwards, the more likely the trend will continue downwards.

Therefore, you know and get the idea of the market trend especially for a long term.
