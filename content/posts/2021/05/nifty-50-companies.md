You heard about NIFTY 50 companies a lot and it has a number as well, i.e 50 making it **NIFTY 50.** Why exactly?

This is because Nifty is an index that is solely made on these 50 top companies in the Stock Market. Now you might be having lots of questions and that's okay since we will learn about these companies along with their weightage in the NIFTY 50 Index.

## Who Decides Top 50 Companies in NIFTY 50 Companies?

Well, the answer is pretty simple. No one decides the top 50 companies in this index however it is placed on the basis of Market Capitalization also known as the Market Cap of the company.

Now **Market Cap** is something that many isn't aware of but it shows us the market value of a particular public traded company's outstanding shares.

It is calculated on the simple formula, that is, **Share Price multiplied by the Oustanding Shares** in the market.

Let's take an example of **XYZ Limited.**

- The share price of XYZ Limited is **Rs 200**
- The outstanding shares of XYZ Limited are 10,000
- Therefore the Market Cap of XYZ Limited is 200 x 10,000 which equals **20,00,000 (20 Lakhs)**
