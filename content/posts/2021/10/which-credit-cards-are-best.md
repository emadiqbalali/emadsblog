Are you looking to increase your credit score or do you still don't have any score? To be honest, you're not alone. I am going to cover up all about the credit cards available in India for you. Credit Cards aren't some fancy financial instruments to have, they give you stability and help you save some amount of money for using them effectively.

Indeed, it is not your money and is a type of unsecured loan provided to you by the bank but they provide you many benefits to use them. If you know how to properly use credit cards then you've nothing to worry about.

However, if you don't know how to use actually use them then you might end up in the solid trap. Let me tell you the disadvantages of Credit Cards **if you default** on the bills and so on.

1. Very High Interest Rate charged by most of the banks typically ranging from **35-45%**
2. Impact your [credit score](https://sastaeinstein.com/how-to-improve-credit-score-2021/) severely such that you can't get a loan in future or even though if you get you will attract much higher interest rates.
3. You have to use it for personal use. **Any commercial use might lead to cancellation of your card immediately.**

## The Best Credit Cards In India

This list, however, is a personal opinion but let me tell you that the list is personally curated after researching about the benefits each one of the cards provides. You can easily go through them and pick the one you're most suitable with. For those of you without any score, I have also listed down the FD Secured Credit Cards as well as Unsecured Credit Card that might be worth applying to see if they issue for you even without any score. I personally tested that card which issued the card even without any score.

This card is for the one who regularly shops on Amazon for their daily needs or essentials as well as pay bills and much more. Apart from this, this card comes with a **ZERO** annual fee and is best suited for Shopping.

It provides you with 1% cashback on all transactions other than Amazon, which is quite good compared to rest of the credit card which gives similar cashback but attracts a huge annual fee.

Those who actively shop on Amazon can get a cashback of 3% (Non-Prime) and 5% (Prime) respectively and this is a very good deal, to be honest.

If you switch to Amazon Pay for recharges, bill payments and so on, you will be able to get **2%** Cashback.
