Without wasting time, let's get started!

## 3 Highest Paying URL Shorteners:

- **[Link5S](https://link5s.co/ref/e7z7Qhnx):** It is one of the highest paying URL Shortening service. My average CPM is about $2 since I started using it. It is simple and is not popular with spamming. You're allowed to use the shortened URLs on Facebook, Twitter and any other social sites. You can join now by clicking on it's name! They payout using PayPal and other options. For those in Vietnam, they allow direct transfer to banks.

- **[Adfly](https://join-adf.ly/9435389)**: It is another URL shortening service. People often find it spam. But, they're real. They pay you the amount on time. They usually allow you to withdraw using PayPal, Payoneer and more. If you're signing up for the first time, you should wait for their withdrawal date. After your first withdrawal, you can withdraw any time from the settings if you payment exceed their withdrawal limit of $5 in case of PayPal. I took almost 3 Payments of $5 so far. They paid me on time. [_You can read my review on Adfly here_](https://sastaeinstein.com/2016/11/is-adfly-is-a-scam-review.html). Adfly only downside is that some countries have really low CPC.

- **[Shorte.st:](http://join-shortest.com/ref/8917b8a945?user-type=new)** Yet another shortening service which also pays you high compare to more other shortening services. It looks premium. It also runs a service called "Mining". You can just download the App "Miner" and use a token API key to earn money by leaving computer idle or just work regularly. If you want to earn like this, click the below image to download Miner and start earning.

Earning with URL shortener is pretty easy when you have like loads of traffic. You can drive people to click on your link by giving away something they want.

Let's say for example, I created a site based on Gaming niches. Basically, people come on to my site for downloading something related to gaming.

All I do is upload that file and turn it's original link into a shortened one and then share it on my website.

Now, they tend to click on it and that's how pretty easy it is to earn money with such URL shorteners.

If you're earning or monetizing your site with some another Shortening service which pays you higher, don't forget to leave it in the comment section below.

However, using such shorteners along with [Google Adsense](https://sastaeinstein.com/2017/03/is-adsense-worth-it-how-much-you-get-paid-by-google-adsense.html) sometimes leads to the wrong way. You may get banned for violating their TOS as Google don't want their users to land up on some other sites.

The URL shorteners says, there is no issue with using their services along with Adsense.

As far as I know, **I'm using some shortening services along with Adsense** as well and I don't have issues so far.
