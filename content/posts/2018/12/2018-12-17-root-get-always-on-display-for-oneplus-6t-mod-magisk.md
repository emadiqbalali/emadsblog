## How To Download Mod And Flash It?

It is a very simple mod made exclusively for OnePlus 6T. Don't try it on any other device.

2. Download the [MOD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xi53_g9rYg5H-vxoKbN4wRxGOVpj4lyi/view?usp=sharing).
3. Flash the MOD using Magisk.
4. Done. Now you'll find the option to enable in Settings/Display/Ambient Display

_Removing the MOD is causing bootloop. Therefore, if you ever removed the MOD then please_ delete **/data/resource-cache** via TWRP to fix the bootloop

It is recommended that you disable the MOD instead of uninstalling. Uninstalling causes bootloops for many users. If you uninstalled it and now it is causing Bootloops, flash this **[File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XiNwcaHBH32j_CFS1SuPMX4Ij2hC4Ivv/view?usp=sharing)** to fix it.
