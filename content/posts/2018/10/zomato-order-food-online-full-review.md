Food Food Food! We all need a lot of food. Do we? Zomato Order Food Online: Full Review.

Ordering online on Zomato or Uber Eats? Cannot decide which one is for you? We'll help you here getting your food at the best price you can ever.

Zomato was dealing with **Swiggy.** Now, why didn't I put Swiggy in? Swiggy delivers from way more restaurants than Zomato yet it is a plain no for many people due to its service and especially pricing. The amount they charge for deliveries. Rarely, offers do pop up which many can use. Usually, they are all related to specific Bank Cards which all of them don't have. Enough about **Swiggy.** Let's move to our real topic, _Zomato Order Food Online: Review_

Zomato is pretty popular in India with it's solid joining offers and day to day offers along with the new Piggy Bank offers. 

### Zomato Order Food Online: Review

The more the benefits, the more its better and of course a better review.

- Joining offer with their promo code "**NEW50"** gets you flat 50% off up to 150 Rupees on first 5 orders. Pay On Delivery or Cash On Delivery is not available when this Promo code is used. #DigitalIndia already so, many of them don't mind it. PayTM available too so yes, it's easy peezy!
- Piggy Bank (Available only on App) saves you a number of pennies on each order you do despite using any Promo Code. Join [PiggyBank](https://zoma.to/piggybank) (Open Link on Mobile) to get 50 coins free. Use my Code "**EMAD5074**"
- Almost all delivery is just free. Some of them might charge you up to 20-30 rupees.
- Fast service, sometimes it gets delayed due to rush at Restaurants. I get all delivery in average 15-30 minutes.
- The order went wrong, got wrong? Have complaints? Zomato Chat got you covered. They help you in all ways as there's a real human helping you. I got help twice and satisfied with the service. There are cases where Delivery guys couldn't deliver what I ordered and when complained they offered me enough credits for next order.
- Almost all restaurants are covered in the cities. However, some do not opt for online ordering but still can be booked or their menu can be checked.
