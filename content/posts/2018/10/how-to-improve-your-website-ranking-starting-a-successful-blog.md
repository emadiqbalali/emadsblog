## How To Improve Your Website Ranking?

**Maintaining a writing streak:-**

It's as simple as you think. Improving your website ranking requires your attention towards your website. By attention, it can be the streak of your writing and generating content on your website. You have to maintain a streak of posting on your website to fetch you some traffic from here and there. People make billions of search every day and in those searches, you might land only if you produce new posts consistently. Maintaining a perfect writing streak on your blog might make your blog popular any day. Not only focusing on generating newer content but also focusing on its quality, it always raises your website ranking effectively.

**Proper usage of Tags and keywords:-**

Another important trick here is the usage of Tags and Keywords. I already mentioned about people searching billions of terms daily. To get into people's so-called terms you need to define something in the post to help Search Engines get your site to them. This is done with the help of either Tags or Keywords. Your tags can be placed at the bottom of the posts by putting "Tags" as the headline. The keywords are placed in Title, Headings, and body of the post for effective ranking. The keywords can be used multiple times within the post to increase the chances of improving your website rank.

**Avoiding SEO basic mistakes:-**

Many noobs or beginner bloggers just start the blog right away. They usually fail to understand the concept behind the SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) which is the backbone when it comes to rankings. When your website satisfies the basic needs for SEO, the website is ranked more efficiently and fast.
