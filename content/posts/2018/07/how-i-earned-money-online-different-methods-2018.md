## **How I Made Money Online?**

Talking about me? I made money online after learning some great tricks from the people who successfully did it before. I then spent my entire time researching on everything I learnt and remove the things which were not supposed to be there. Alas, I came up with most effective ways to earn money without investing much into. It can be your only source of income too but not that easy. Let me elaborate those ways, I've come up with.

To give you a great idea, I decided to not bore you enough. Here's have a look at this infographic below.

### **Blogging:-**

It seems easy, but we have a little tough competition too. We can, however, do it well over time to time.

In **blogging**, you never have to do something too cool to get traffic to it. You just have to honest and more reliable to fetch a good amount of viewer or say readers online. Starting a blog right now will never be too late for you. The earlier you start, the better it is. Before starting a blog, research on the niche(Topic) you're good at. You shouldn't be starting it and not posting anything in a while thinking about what to post. It's usually a trap where people fall in and finally thinks its stupid that they say we can earn real money using blogging.  
You just need to investigate and make a habit of learning to read and write. Copy Pasting, however, doesn't work all the time. They do work, but maybe a luck could do it.  
To be honest, I made around $45 in 6 months. It was not that good, however, good enough as it improves gradually. Apart from blogging, I use Affiliated Links and shortening URL services to make some more bucks along with Blogging.

[Start your blog right now. Start writing content.](https://sastaeinstein.com/2016/12/10/how-to-start-a-blog-and-what-platform-we-should-choose-2017/) You're never late to do this.

### Affiliation:-

Earning money by Affiliation is the real thing. It requires your viewers and readers to engage with the product you listed and place an order before you make a commission. To make it happen, you will need a pretty decent amount of traffic on your site as it increases the probability of it happening. It can fetch you a good amount of money for real.

### Paid URL Shortening:- 

It is not a tough job to do. You will have to use some of the free URL shortening service providers online to shorten the real link you are going to share on the site. The reader will be clicking on it to see some Ads. These service providers pay you for views. It can help you make good money if you have a site that deals with downloads. 

For Example,

**[Adfly](https://join-adf.ly/9435389)** pays you $5 on 10,000 views. Similarly, another URL Shortener varies.

_I have read online about Adfly being a spam. But I didn't encounter any kind of issues. They pay me once I reach their $5 threshold. I have also written an article on it where I also attached my payment screenshots. [Read it here](https://sastaeinstein.com/2016/11/11/is-adfly-is-a-scam-review/)._
