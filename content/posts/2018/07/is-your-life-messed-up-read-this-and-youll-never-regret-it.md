Looks like I've been getting a lot of request on how I enjoy my life the perfect way. I have down that you would have never seen but well, on the outside, I stay cooler with following up on that schedule I prepared below.  
  
Are you feeling down? Is your life messed up? We have got you. Everyone in their own lives felt it sometimes sooner or sometimes later. Life is small, we should be living it happily often than sadly.  
  
Being happy is not all about life but also enjoying it. There are much better ways you should spend your life. These ways can actually make more challenging stuff in your life. I am again telling you that life is not about rich lifestyle. Owning Gucci, Lambo & Rolex doesn't fulfil the criteria of living a good lifestyle. A life that is spent with Priorities, Plans, Entertainments and Investments is what a good lifestyle indicates.   
  
I made an infographic to help you out if your life is messed up. Hope you'll like it. If yes, then share it. You can also pin it to your board. xD

### What Do I Do For Amazing Lifestyle?

- I enjoy a lot in life. I learn I share, and I laugh in life. It's not that I don't get sad on things, but I make sure that they are minimized to a large extent and increase things around which makes me happy & Stress-free.
- I spend much of my time with family & friends. Giving time to them is essential in life than your work. Work is not all in your life, people should get over it.
- I manage priorities for everything. I know what to prefer first and what to prefer second. When you maintain it, you always know what comes first. It applies in case of point 2.
- Reading is now underrated. Today's youth never knows the power of reading. Reading fetch you the knowledge and virtual experience. Reading anything you're interested in can help you in developing skills and practice it in real time.
- I spend money on the things I need. It's not like, I need it because it will make me look cooler in front of people. People don't give the shit of what you have. Buy the things which help you with something. It shouldn't be something not necessary.
- Health is wealth. Lastly, I must tell you that diet is important. You cannot just eat anything you want. Maintaining a good diet can make you live longer and help you in preventing many kinds of diseases.
