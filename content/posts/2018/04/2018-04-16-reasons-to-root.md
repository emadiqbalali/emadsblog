## Cons (disadvantages):-

1. More security related issues will pop up. 
2. The system file you have access to can be dangerous if anything related to OS is deleted even by mistake can **Corrupt** and brick your device.
3. Many applications on the Google PlayStore which is related to Banking especially doesn't allow you to proceed further with your rooted device by giving a warning inside the app.
4. New Phone? Rooting **VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY** but this issue is when it is related to software thing. Cracked screen? You can claim the warranty.
5. No official updates from your manufacturer will be sent to you. That is OTA updates for the software that is Android L, M, N & so on.

That's it. If you're brave enough or a hardcore fun gamer then root your device and enjoy it. However, make sure you don't mess with system settings and adware you get online while browsing.
