**UPDATE:**  
**Many people claimed that this is not working for all. Alternatively, you can try registering SIM on 3G first i.e, by switching network to ONLY 3G then to ONLY LTE/4G to fix this problem.** **It works perfectly on devices like, Redmi, Oppo, Vivo, etc**

Do you really get into this problem where you are able to receive calls on your Smartphone but cannot call them back on Airtel 4G sim card? Are you not able to do outgoing calls from your Airtel Sim Card? Here is "How to fix Airtel Call Ended Issues?"

I know, you've been exactly like this when it happens with you! Like damn it Airtel. I'm gonna switch to Jio!

If yes, then you're probably at the right place. We're familiar with this issue happening to a lot of people who planned to get Jio sim cards before but it was happening due to **VoLTE** unavailability or it may be disabled. If you're using Jio right now and facing this issue then you might need to find the VoLTE settings to enable it or simply download Jio 4G Voice from AppStore or PlayStore.

However, in the case of **Airtel**, it's not about VoLTE. Airtel uses to switch back technology where it uses 3G for calling and 4G for mobile internet, unlike Jio which uses VoLTE for voice and 4G for data.

I ported my postpaid Vodafone (GSM) sim card to Airtel 4G via MNP. After 3 days, it was successfully ported and I got my signal bars on Airtel sim card.

When I popped in my Airtel Sim Card, I recharged it successfully with the respective package. I was now able to send SMS and browse the Internet and even receive incoming calls but I cannot call someone as when I decided to call someone it automatically says "_Call Ended"._

To fix this issue, I wrote this article as it was nowhere much to be found online and you need to dig into forums deep to fix it.

## How To Fix "Call Ended" Issue With Airtel 4G Sim Cards?

### Samsung or Other Android Devices

1. Go to keypad where you can dial a number.
2. Type in **#31#** to kill the Caller ID service. The call ending issue is due to the caller ID service.
3. You're now able to make an outgoing call without that annoying Call Ended thing.

**Note:** _If in case, you need to enable Caller ID service again then type **\*31#** to enable it again._

### Xiaomi Mi & Redmi Devices

1. Go to Keypad where you can dial a number.
2. Type in **#34#** to disable the caller ID service and make outgoing calls.
3. Boom! You are now able to make outgoing calls without Call Ending issues.

**Disclaimer:** _I know there is an option for Showing/Hiding Caller ID from Call Settings but when you go there it shows that it is default as per service provider and doesn't let you change. Therefore, we have to use this USSD method to disable the Caller ID service completely._
