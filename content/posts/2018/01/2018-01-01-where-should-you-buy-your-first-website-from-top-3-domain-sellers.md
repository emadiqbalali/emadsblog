Starting from the number 1, we have the list goes as follows:  
  
  

- [**GoDaddy**](http://www.godaddy.com/): To be honest, it is one of the best domain registrars at least according to me. The servers are much more reliable, the price is affordable and their customer service is just hassle-free.
