Let's begin the war. We will give you the pros and cons of both of them and will leave the decision on you. It's your choice now whether you go for a console or the PC.  

### Gaming Consoles

#### Pros:

- You never need to upgrade it as frequent as PC. Once you own a console, then it works for years.
- You never need to worry about other things such as updating software frequently as MAC or Windows need on PC.
- No complicated controllers like Mouse+Keyboard which is big hassle for many users. A simple joystick does it for you.
- You can enjoy the offline multiplayer with your siblings with ease.
- You can play games upto 4K if the game supports. 
- It takes less space in your room. 

#### Cons:

- You must buy a TV which can cost a fortune if you want to get all the performance from your console. 4K LED or OLED is the one you'll must probably go for.
- The Game DVD's can also be expensive when it comes to console if you're willing to play online and don't want to jtag your console. (You can spend and buy console for PC too)
- You cannot enjoy the browsing internet like you do on your PC. If you're a YouTuber then console is not your thing.
- Limited Storage and not customizable as per your preference.

### Gaming PC/Laptop

#### Pros:

- You don't need to always buy game. You can have fun with cracked exe's and ini files and enjoy the game. The PC version of the game also seems better.
- You can browse internet seamlessly and edit your recorded game plays.
- You also don't need to buy any other game play recording stuff. A software would do it for you.
- It helps you customize your graphics and upgrade your system according to your preference.
- You can give a new look to setup by assembling two or more monitors as per your preference.

#### Cons:

- Keeping an eye on virus, updates and various other things can be hassle for many people.
- It covers more area in your room.
- Gaming Computers need better cooling. Your room should be equipped with good ventilation.
- Not portable as console. 
- They make big hole in your pocket as they cost fortunes.
