Most of the people in India claims that all celebrities use iPhone because it shows a symbol of being rich. While many of them think iPhones are overrated. In my opinion, it's not overrated. It was never. I know many of the people couldn't afford it and that doesn't mean it is overrated and is used only for showing a symbol of being rich. When you look back at Apple's history when they launched their first smartphone Apple iPhone in 2007, it was ultimately a huge success for a reason. The reason was that it was totally different from all other smartphones.
