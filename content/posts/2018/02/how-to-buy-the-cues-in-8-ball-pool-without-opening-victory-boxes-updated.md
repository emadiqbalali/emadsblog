Do you know that you can buy any of the 8 Ball Pool Cues without opening those victory boxes in the latest update on Google PlayStore? Yes, that's true. We can buy those cue with coins instead of opening those Victory Boxes every time. It's usually annoying most of the time when you get same cue pieces all the time and most importantly the time it gives you for opening those victory boxes.

Today, in this article I'll be showing you to buy the Cue without even opening any of the Victory Boxes. All you need is 8 Ball Pool Coins.
