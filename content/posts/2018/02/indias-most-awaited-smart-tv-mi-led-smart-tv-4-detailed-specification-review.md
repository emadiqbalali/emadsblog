Amazed? Look how thin this thing is. I don't know about you guys but I'm amazed because this TV is not OLED. It is LED and with just 4.9mm panel that is frame less. Let's take a look at all the features and specification it got.  
  

### DISPLAY

Everyone's first impression while buying a TV is its display and the ability of Color reproduction and viewing angles. Here Mi TV certainly got everything in it. They claim to have **HDR** with **4K**  resolution, this TV is also 55". Despite having HDR, the color production is very vivid and beautiful to look and that's too with a 2160 Pixels on the screen which are of course LEDs. Keeping all aside, the screen on the front is totally bezel less, you don't feel the bezels at all just like your smartphones nowadays. Take a look at it yourself and make yourself satisfied.
