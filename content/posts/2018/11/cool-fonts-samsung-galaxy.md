Bored of the old fonts on your device? I know how it feels. I'm here with some of the cool fonts for all Samsung Galaxy Devices or the device that uses Samsung Flipfont apk to install font on the device.

Changing font is not a big deal. Everyone knows how to do that in the settings however the number of fonts available is limited. In this post, I will show how to get more fonts and apply it the same you do to the other fonts already installed.
