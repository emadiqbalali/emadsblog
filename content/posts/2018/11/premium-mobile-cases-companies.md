# 3 Premium Mobile Cases Companies:

## ****[OtterBox](https://www.otterbox.com):****

It is my personal favourite when my priority is protecting the smartphone from falls. It never stopped impressing me with its sturdiness. It's hard outside and soft inside giving exactly the perfect amount of sock protection from the greatest of heights. Also, they have an amazing series of cases such as **Pursuit, Defender, Symmetry.** To give a whole protection I also recommended the Alpha Glass for screen protection by OtterBox. OtterBox cases always saved my devices from any falls.

Above one is the commuter series for the Galaxy S8. The only downside of the cases is that only some of the series are present in India on Amazon India. However, it's official site ships to India and shipping is free for all orders above $60.
