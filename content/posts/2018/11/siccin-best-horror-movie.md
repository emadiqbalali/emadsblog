I'm really a fan of Mystery and some thriller or horror movies. I would also watch combination of both. I watched everything out there. So far, I watched several highest rated Horror/Thrillers as well such as,

- The Conjuring
- The Conjuring 2
- Annabelle
- Annabelle: Creation
- The Nun
- Insidious 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 (Best Movie Series)
- The Exorcist (Recommended)

There are many others too. I watched some of the Bollywood thriller but all was just fine. Either the story doesn't matches the character or the movie is just plain boring.

I couldn't find movies with amazing story and perfect thrill to experience. I thought about giving a try to a search bar on YouTube. Guess what? It was totally worth it.

I found a movie with amazing story line or master piece of thrill. I'm still thrilled. Even though the movie is in Turkish Language, I watched it with subtitles in English. (Thanks to Siccin Film for uploading with Subs)

## Best Horror Movie Ever

The movie name is **Siccin** in Turkish and is pronounced **Sijjin.** All the parts which are 5 in total are based on Black Magic. The movie plot is set in Islamic country, Turkey where thousands of people approach for doing black magic to destroy other peoples lives on various and particular reasons. Each part has different reasons for Black Magic.

The movie experience can give you complete goose bumps on your skin. It is thrilling combined with disgusting things you can ever think of. You'll definitely ain't be able to sleep without taking the story out of your mind.

**Siccin** is available for free to watch on YouTube. However, only 4 parts of the movie is available currently. 5th part is not released on YouTube.
