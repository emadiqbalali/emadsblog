## A Guide To Start A Blog With SiteGround

Before starting to create your very first blog, you will need to sign up for [**SiteGround**](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/siteground/ "Siteground") and purchase their hosting. Although I guide you throughout the process, their **customer service** is amazing and always assist you perfectly.

## Signing Up For SiteGround Hosting:

### Step 1: Choose A Hosting Plan

The [SiteGround](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/siteground/ "Siteground") offers 3 amazing plans as per your requirement and the first plan is a **StartUp** plan for those who are planning to start. If you're getting started with just a single website or blog, you can go for this plan.

1. The **StartUp** plan is perfect for people with one website that are starting now.
2. The **GrowBig** plan is a great value for money offer, including the option for multiple websites and the SuperCacher that greatly improves website speed.
3. The **GoGeek** plan is perfect for people with e-commerce and larger sites, or more geeky development needs like more server resources and GIT integration.

### Step 3: Review And Complete The Order

Unlike many other hosting providers, SiteGround advertised discount applies to any of the initial periods chosen during the sign up process. Being able to get the low price for the one year period is a fact that increases conversions greatly in comparison to other providers where the lowest monthly price applies only for the longest period. **Therefore, SiteGround is a best choice for hosting.**
