**Unfortunately, this method no longer works with the latest Android 9 (Miracast Update) on the Mi TV 4X Pro 55". If you have older version then you can still go for it and never update the TV.**

However, there is one more method I came up with. Click here for [New Method Update](#newmethod).

I hope in this article you successfully learned how to watch Netflix on Mi TV 4X Pro 55. Due to some unknown reasons with both companies i.e, Netflix and Xiaomi, Mi TV 4X Pro didn't get Netflix even after the latest update of Android 9. However, it got the official support of Amazon Prime which is a good thing.

Unable to find Netflix on your Mi TV 4X PRO 55"? Well, even after the latest Android 9 update the Netflix didn't really make its way to this TV. We were only able to find the Amazon Prime Video when the TV was updated to Android 9. The Prime Video made its way to the TV but unfortunately, Netflix couldn't.

However, with various trial and error, we were able to sort this problem out and really found the way to get Netflix on Mi TV 4X Pro 55" successfully. **Note that this is a workaround and not an actual fix. You've to go through this steps every time you turn off and on the TV. Since Netflix is still not officially support in this Mi TV Model.**
