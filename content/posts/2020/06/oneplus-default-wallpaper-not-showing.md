One fine morning, I was greeted with the new Android 10 update on my OnePlus 7. I jumped with excitement and updated it. To my utter surprise, I cannot find the **Default Wallpapers** on my OnePlus 7.

I tried finding solutions online browsing through various forums including XDA and websites but nothing solved the problem. I finally after hours of research found out that a simple missing APK leads to this "Default Wallpaper not showing on OnePlus" problem.

## How To Get Back The Default Wallpapers On OnePlus 6/6T/7/7T?

This method works almost for all OnePlus devices. It is however tested on OnePlus 7 since I have OnePlus 7 with me. Do let me know in the comments if you have tried and fix it on other models other than OnePlus 7.
