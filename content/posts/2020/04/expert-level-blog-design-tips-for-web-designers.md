As a great portfolio of designs, a great blog should be entertaining, imaginative and insightful and shoIt can be as easy to design a blog as downloading a template and adding a couple of widgets.

But if you choose your site seriously and need it to stand out, then the first step is to understand the principles of design. Some tips on website design will help. Once you know what a good site design does, you can either work alone or find a talented designer. See this [Best Web Design Company](http://licreativetechnologies.com/web-design-company) that has explained about many blogging tips.

As a great portfolio of designs, a great blog should be entertaining, imaginative and insightful and should appeal to your audience. It should clarify why you're different, what you're offering, and why reading should take time. Ready to kick off?

Here are some expert blogging design tips that I put together after three decades of website design independently.

## Choosing A Blogging Platform

Choose a blogging platform from [Blogger and WordPress](https://sastaeinstein.com/how-to-start-a-blog-and-what-platform-we-should-choose-2017/) to Tumblr, Squarespace and Ghost, there are various blogging platforms. Alternatively, you can create your site from scratch if you feel ambitious and understand your coding.

The platform you select will rely largely on what you use most easily, how you want to engage in the production process, and what you intend to do. Place it there.

Most [hosts](https://sastaeinstein.com/hostinger-hosting-review/) are providing a trial session so you can ensure that they're right for you. If not, then seek one of the many free content places open.

## Taking Target-oriented Design Decisions

The design target is to make your web your goals. This is it. While the rest comes in secondary.

How can you do that?

You want a visual hierarchy that leads to an action call. In a simpler sense, present a title or title string that ends with a call to action. And bring this title / call-to-action couple into the places that people see most (for example, the top of the home page, the top of the sidebar, the bottom of the posts, etc.).

## Get A Good Domain Name

Most blogging sites sell you a default subdomain, but you really need to buy your own domain name if you want to be taken seriously. You'll need something simple, memorable, and most importantly, easy to read, and the top-level domain name to be careful about.

You can find all sorts of advanced TLDs accessible these days like .blog or .agency, but for the classics there's a lot to say; if you can find the domain you like with excellent old fashioned.com then do it.

**Use 2-3 fonts, Max** 

Use a font for your logo at most, one for your headlines and one for your text. More, and your web is going to look dirty.

## Choose Blogging Material

You need to learn how to start a blog but do you know exactly what a website you need to start with? Blogging via [blogging is pointless](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141128104243-49144655-your-company-blog-a-waste-of-time) - you'll soon get bored and your beautifully built website will soon be just a treadmill.

Often, it's a good idea to bring a notepad and pencil before you start (and check out our article on the best laptops for artists, if you like your stationery). Write down the types of blog posts you'd like to write so you've already got a benchmark that you can go back to if ideas start to run out.

Only then can you understand how to start a blog if you continue, now is the time to design and fill it out...

**Using 2-3 colours, Max** 

The blog will have a primary colour, a Gray hue, and a colour call-to-action. The key colour is the first colour that people want to see and the last colour that they want to recall. It's bright blue for Hello Restaurant.

The Gray tone lets you subtly illustrate those areas of your design. The call-to-action colour would be used sparingly because, you thought, when determining what to do next, you want people to look for the colour. It is orange to Hello Sign.

## Keeping Your Blog Design Easy

It can be tempting to go a little wild while making a web blog. You want your blog to be heard, after all, and people want to remember you. What bad can a bright rainbow and a variety of fonts be?

Keep your blog crafted with ease. Having only three fonts and three colours. With sources; a title font, a subtitle and a copy of the body are needed. You can improve your main text font with different attributes or weights but keep them to a minimum.
