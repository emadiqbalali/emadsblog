## Do You Have Proof To Show Us?

Yes, I know words aren't enough. I am still a beginner blogger but I manage to earn more than $300-$400 in a month from blogging and various other online services.

I do provide some gigs on Fiverr and earn side income, proof reading and uploading for other bloggers out there. I also earn from my blog by monetizing it with advertisement networks like **Adsense** and some product affiliates from Amazon or Plugins, & Themes affiliates.

Here is the screenshot to my Affiliate reports of Hosting, I hide my beautiful stats for the month, but I was able to make around **$43** this month.

Here, is my Adsense report for this blog. Hope it helps, again I am hiding my stats for not violating Google's Policy which can lead to my account ban. Google is strict with policies. xD

**Also, if you see this stats, you will know that Google Adsense literally doesn't let you earn penny if your blog doesn't have thousand of views in a single day.**
