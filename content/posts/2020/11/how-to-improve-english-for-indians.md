Are you embarrassed already that you can't understand the **COMPLEX** words from a book or magazine?

I know the feeling. Period.

_Please refrain from standing, as you may fall off on the ground while reading this post._

What? What do I do? What's _the refrain?_

I am certainly not being racist by putting up "**FOR INDIAN"** in the title, but hey, Indian English sucks! I mean, I am not looking forward to telling you that the Indian accent sucks however they literally can't understand the words. 

Come on now; I am not blaming every person living in India. You're probably here because you know your English sucks.

You don't like it this way! You want it to be better. How?

Hey, I am just like you, an Indian. I don't know how my English sounds like, but to be honest, I do receive compliments from **INDIANS** going WOW, your English is amazing.

Ohh, really! I exclaimed. 

Then I smiled. 

That's it. 

No, of course not. 

English is a language that you have to master; you need to work on it much harder to improve it.

# How Can I Improve My English?

It's simple. You need to follow simple steps and give it time. 

- **Start Reading.** 

Let it be anything but in English. A Novel, Story Book, or Newspaper. Whatever it might be, just read and try to understand yourself. 

Whenever you can't, lookup on Google or a dictionary. It's better to gift yourself a mini Oxford Dictionary.

- **Know your grammar.** 

Grammar is important. 

You can't ignore it. You can't wake up in the morning and text to your friend,

**_I was their last night in the party bruh!_**

Well, that sounds awful.

- **Watch Movies In English (or) Watch English Movies**

Anything works. Watch movies or anything you like to watch in English of course without Subtitles. 

Watching something in English with subtitles is like watching "How to Pick up the chair?" on YouTube.

- [Vocabulary.com](https://vocabulary.com) **helps you enhance your English Vocabulary**

That's not a tough job. You just need to visit the link and create an account for yourself to get started learning English words. The better your English word flows, the better and professional your English sounds.

## Why You Should Learn To Speak & Write English Properly?

To me, the accent doesn't really matter. However, proper English does matter. If you're pursuing a professional career in the main language English and you can't write or speak English in a better way then you're in a bad situation.

This is a skill that one should always master. Communication will be a key role in the future. 

_There is one thing for sure. I mean for real._

You don't love reading? Your English sucks! This is a fact. You can expect to be a master by learning alphabets and some words. There's a huge list of words you never heard of in the English language, therefore, when you keep reading books, you're introduced to these words and you are eager to learn them as you want to understand the story or book you're reading.

Secondly, I prefer listening to songs and watch English language movies without subtitles to enhance your listening skills. 

**Meditate, Meditate, Meditate!**

Go stand in front of your mirror, look at yourself in your eyes, and speak whatever you want to in English. 

Challenge yourself in talking perfectly without breaks and irrelevant pauses here and there. 

I am not your English professor from college. However, I use the above methods to improve my English or at least to come to this level.

**Can't brainstorm on what to read? Checkout my library.**
