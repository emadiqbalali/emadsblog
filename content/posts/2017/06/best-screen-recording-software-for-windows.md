Bandicam is a screen recording software for windows with many great features. It comes in both a paid and free version. However, the free version watermarks the video you recorded.   
  
The main features of Bandicam include:  

- You can record selected areas of the screen.
- Real-Time drawing.
- You can also add webcam overlay in case of recording gameplay or tutorials.
- You can record and mix your own voice along with system voice.
- Add a logo to your video.
- You can enable mouse effect which helps the viewers.

# **2\. Camtasia Studio 8**

Camtasia is an advanced screen recording software. It has many professional features unlike Bandicam and it is much harder to use. Although, it gives us professional editing to our recorded videos.

Some of the Pro features are:

- Add special video effects
- Drag-n-drop your edits
- Animated Background
- Music Tracks
- Icons
- Motion Graphics
- Annotations
- Screen Recording
- Webcam Overlay
- Media splitting and cutting
- Transition 

I personally recommended buying this software for a better experience. You will never regret it. 

If you ask my opinion, then go for Camtasia. It is best with robust editing features along with Screen RecordingÂ + Video Editing. You can always allow some time to learn it.

Thanks for reading!
