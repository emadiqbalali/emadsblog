Today, we are going to talk about this infamous browser. Yes, it is underrated even though it has great features such as **Battery Saver, Data Saver, Messenger** and **WhatsApp Web.** It is simple and easiest to operate with it's finest Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
  
Apart from this, the most versatile feature of this browser is that you can actually browse much faster. This feature is known _Opera Turbo._  It enable Opera to be super fast while browsing. I love this feature. Opera has been my default browser since I found it out last few months ago.  
  
I must say **Good Job** Opera! We appreciate it.  
  
Now, let's come to another service provided for free bundled within this browser. A free **VPN** service.
