**To fix this issue:**  
Make sure you've done the following before if not then try it, your luck may work sometimes.  
  
  

1. Restart your Phone and Router. Now, check if it fixes it.Â 
2. Go to recovery, then Wipe Cache. Reboot and see if it fixes.
3. Go to recovery, then Factory Reset your device. Now, check if it fixes it.
