Hey Guys! Welcome to Emad's Blog!  
  
Are you enjoying the Windows 10 anniversary update but disappointed of the Wi-Fi dropping issue?  
I got Windows 10 Anniversary update last week and have been facing this issue. I was very disappointed with this issue and lastly found the solution to it. The issue here is that after usingÂ my PC/Laptop for some time and you automatically get Wi-Fi to limited access and then Wi-Fi shows no network found. I had to restart my Laptop to fix this. At last I got this thing fixed and decided to share with you all who have this same problem after updating to Windows 10. 
  
Let's fix it. Follow the steps given below:  
  

- Go to Control Panel and search for **Device Manager.**

- Now open **Device Manager** and expand the **Network Adapters** to find your Wireless Adapter.

- Now double click on your Wifi Adapter to open it's properties windows. In properties choose **Power Management** tab. In that tab uncheck the box to fix the issue.
