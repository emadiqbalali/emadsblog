Recently, the tech giant Google released the new payment application called **Tez** in India. Now, from 2019 onwards they changed it from Tez to Google Pay. 

Within just 3 days, it reached 100K downloads on the Playstore. 

It is no fact that India has been playing a major role in upgrading the payment methods digitally. Google's Tez App is going to compete for **BHIM** payment application out there. This application cannot directly compete with PayTM and other mobile wallets as it uses **UPI (Unified Payments Interface).** It will use Bank accounts to make payment via phone.

Therefore, there isn't a thing called top up your balance. It directly pays through your bank account. The application even has a Cash Mode that will enable instant transactions with anyone nearby without sharing personal details like a phone number or bank account. It supports many regional languages.

It also encourages by setting up a reward of Rs 51 to those who referred it to other people and they made their first payment. They also told that you can earn up toÂ Rs 9000 per financial year and this reward is valid till 1 April 2018.

There's a good chance that you'll be earning around 9,000 by just referring to other people on this Tez application.
