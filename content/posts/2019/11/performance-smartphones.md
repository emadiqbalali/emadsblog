Are you not the big fan of changing or upgrading smartphones everywhere but doesn't want to compromise the speed and performance? Well, this curated list is just for you.

All the smartphones in this list are handpicked for performance and speed which likely to stay in power for at least 2 years. Not everyone in 2019, is willing to take smartphones based on performance but in 2020, we believe everyone will be willing to for speed, especially when the payment methods are going online.

I've seen people making payment through their smartphones and app loading speeds are drastic and making Queue behind. I personally prefer faster smartphones for this one purpose, secondly, we have amazing [graphics intense games](https://sastaeinstein.com/top-v-mobile-games-with-beautiful-graphics/) being released which requires a performance smartphone to play perfectly without lags and win.

So, I want to ask you, if you're tired of your slower phone from either 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018? If yes, then you're looking to upgrade to a smartphone which will never go out of speed within the next 2 years. Let's check out the amazing list of performance smartphones from the year 2019 which will, of course, stay with you till 2021.

Also, this year the graphic intensive games have been on the AppStore & PlayStore trending list of games. The [Player's Unknown Battleground PubG](https://sastaeinstein.com/how-pubg-started-infographic/) is the most played game in India and the smartphones below handle this game at high graphics like a pro phone. 

Asphalt 9 however made it well on the phone. The OnePlus 7T just rocked it even though it is slightly way out of budget but still a performance flagship in the lower price.

### Conclusion

The 3 smartphones above are personally tested and I found it amazingly well in performance wise, but hey they look good too. The first phone might create a dent in the pocket but if you're going to keep it for next **3 years** then invest the money into it and you'll be amazed with its performance if you look forward after 3 years.

Also, wait a minute, if you're just looking to play PubG in your smartphone then it's a bad idea to ditch your current smartphone for playing just that game. If you have a PC/Laptop lying around then you can play PubG in it as well. [Check out the guide.](https://sastaeinstein.com/pubg-mobile-for-pc-free/)
