In the morning, my phone beeped. I picked it up and saw I got a mail and it was from Matt. I was surprised, I quickly opened it up and check out that he wanted me to have a look at their amazing plugin they just made. 

I was excited, I thought why not give it a try. I myself till this plugin was creating boxes using Elementor for promoting products on my site from Amazon. All done manually from Image links to affiliate links via the Stripe features.

I replied to the Matt email asking him for access to their plugin and I would love to review Amalinks Pro without hesitation as I never came to know the easy way to showcase products on website especially from Amazon.

Next day, he gave me access and here I am reviewing the Amalinks Pro plugin solely based on my opinion. According to me, I am really new to affiliate marketing niche sites. If you also happen to be a beginner or looking to start an affiliate marketing niche site and plan to take products from Amazon then you might relate to this article.

Before starting, here's my quick score for the plugin.

# My Detailed Review of Amalinks Pro

What is **[Amalinks Pro](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/amalinkspro)** at first place? Well, it is a premium plugin which solves the major problem of all the hassles required in making an Amazon Affiliate Site for earning money. 

In short, you can say this plugin helps in boosting your earnings from the Amazon Associates Program.

**Do you know?** There are so many hassles to make an Amazon Affiliate Site based on any niche. 

For example:

1. You need to make tables yourself for Amazon Products and link them with your affiliate link
2. There's no easy way to link products, you have to open up Amazon site then use Stripe option to create links and images.
3. You cannot showcase reviews and products with description directly from Amazon. If you want to do, then all should be done manually making it a very time-consuming.

**Guess What?**

**[Amalinks Pro](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/amalinkspro/ "AmalinksPro")** just solve all those problems above.
