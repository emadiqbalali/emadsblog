## **The Possibility of Making Money With Instagram**

So, what is the possibility of making money by Instagram profile? Yes, that's the question I have been receiving for long now. Many have been asking me to give away the best Instagram blogging tips.

There is a strategy involved in this, the simple trick on paper if we see, is that to generate the content which looks outstanding and then using them, we can generate the followings. This way, you also place the clear CTA (Click To Action) from the profile in the description of the post and a link in the bio of the Instagram profile.

The Click To Action Link will actually point to your [affiliate links](https://sastaeinstein.com/top-highest-paying-affiliate-networks-you-should-sign-up-now-to-earn-money-online/), or the online store if you own one. This is the easiest way if you see to sell your products.

To break it down, **generate content ---> gain views & likes ---> generate followings ---> increase chances of link clicks and action on your site/affiliate site.**

The great following is never necessary and you shouldn't get demotivated that you don't have enough following and it will take a lot of time. Ever heard of [microblogging with Instagram](https://sastaeinstein.com/blogging-with-instagram/)? If not then check it out. The brands usually pay enough to mention on your profile with the less following and targeted audience.

Although this is just the possibilities we discussed, actually there are 3 major ways to Earn Money With Instagram.

## **The 3 Major Ways To Earn Money On Instagram**

1. Becoming An Affiliate Marketer (The Easiest Way)
2. Making yourself an Influencer (Moderately Easy)
3. Selling your own products (Toughest One)

## **Becoming An Affiliate Marketer On Instagram**

If you see for real, you must be already aware of Affiliate Marketers. The term "Affiliate Marketing" is a little messed up. We have people promoting products for just money without even adding value to it and mentioning about earning 6-figure income and owning Lamborghini's.

This is absurd. I agree that some or say 1% are able to do it but 99% of the time they can't.

Becoming an affiliate marketer on Instagram and earn money by Instagram can be a little tricky, however, if you implement the right way to do it then no one can stop you from earning money on an automated way.

Breaking down, affiliate marketing we see the steps involve in it...

**Creating Engaging Content ---> Gain Competetive Enagagement ---> Giving Out Real Value Why Should One Buy The Product ---> Use Instagram Checkout**

Whenever someone purchases with the link you provided, you receive a commission. This way you earn money.

Creating an eye-catching content is never easy, but you can always try and see what works the best. You can use the exclusive short videos made professionally by the company of the product and simply help people in deciding if they should go for it. You can also create an infographic post explaining why one should use the product and increase the chances of them buying it.

### Step 1: Choosing A Niche

The first step is to finalize a niche in which you're going to promote products. You're just going there on Instagram by placing whatever products. You should stick to one niche, like for example, sticking with Fashion niche means you can promote the clothing and relevant things to fashion from a brand and sell them with your affiliate link and in return earning a commission.

### Step 2: Finding A Merchant To Affiliate With

This is the second important step. An affiliate merchant should be paying you well enough and reputable to pay you on time. There are many affiliate merchants out there and the most reputable ones are Amazon Affiliate Program, CJ Affiliates, MaxBounty and Clickbank.

### Step 3: Finally Post About The Product And Link To It

In this step, you generate content that is either a post that is outstanding or eye-catching and then explain why one should get it. Convert those viewers into the buyers. You end up earning commission once they buy the product.

Becoming an influencer was never an easy deal. You will need a lot of exposure and competitive engagement rates to be an influencer. If you work hard for real on this I'm sure you can be one. Go ahead, give it a read anyway.

The first thing first is that you need to stand out. There are over 1 Billion monthly users on Instagram as we discussed in facts. Let's get into the steps needed to be an influencer.

### Step 1: Define/Choose Niche

Yes, being an influencer requires choosing a niche too. You have to stick to one niche and create hype around it. It doesn't even matter that you have **50K or just 5000** followers. All it matters is how engaging the audience is with your post and how you're dominating the niche.

### Step 2: Creating The Highest Quality Content

### Step 3: Don't Mess With Feed

You have to keep an eye on your feed and how it makes an impression on the visitors of your profile. You have to keep consistent and eye-catching at the same time. Doing this, it increases engagement and for working with brands, all it matter is the engagement statistics. It's not all about the followers, it's about the skills of your content and the engagement you can make out of it.

### Step 4: Stay With Schedule

I have previously discussed the [best times to post on Instagram](https://sastaeinstein.com/best-insta-hastags-for-profile-visits/) in one of my previous article on Instagram. Make sure you check it out, so you can also grab an idea of using proper hashtags from that. This is one of the Instagram blogging tips.

So, in this step all you have to do plan your postings in a week on Instagram. This way you will stay consistent and will gain more engagement over time. You can easily use tools like [Planoly](https://www.planoly.com/) to plan, manage and schedule your Instagram posts.

### Step 5: Don't Let Your Followers Feel Lonely

In short, you need to engage with your followers on a regular basis to connect with them emotionally and also they should be knowing who you are before they can engage with everything you post on a daily basis.

If there is lack of such engagement then it is hard to get them converted and you'll lose the engagement ratio as well. You can engage with your followers, asking them a question with stories or occasional posts asking for tips from them or how they like something to do.

You can also go live and answer their questions. It's fun!

## **Selling Your Own Products**

Remember, I marked it as the toughest one in the category but still, nothing is difficult when you work for it. I've gathered some valuable steps for this one too and they turn out to be helpful for many. First let's take a look at how selling on Instagram looks like for major brands, **the shoppable tags.** However, we are not going to look into this as a major brand selling Jewellery and clothing are using it.

### Step 2: Post Eye-Catching Product Pictures And Promote

Now, the second step is all about posting regularly with great taglines and discounts for luring people towards your shopping site. You can offer **Black Friday Sales** and or huge discounts if coming from Instagram or similar tactics.
