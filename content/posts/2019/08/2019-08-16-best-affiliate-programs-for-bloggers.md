I know there are plenty of Affiliate Programs out there. There are some that approves your site before you can work with them. As my blog has number of readers who are just beginners out there so I decided to put up the handpicked Affiliate programs that doesn't requires the approval thing.

I will mention the Affiliate Networks that require Approval along with the list of them. Without further ado, let's get started.

### **[Amazon Affiliate Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)** (Instant Approval)

This affiliate program tops the list. Everyone knows Amazon. It is one of the biggest conglomerate and it is doubt they run the world largest online shopping website where millions of people place orders every day. On Amazon at an average, 300+ orders are placed every single second.

**Let's talk about their commission structure** shared by [Chron](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/amazon-affiliate-commission-structure-63046.html)

- **1.0%** for video games and game consoles
- **2.0%** for televisions and digital download games
- **2.5%** for computers, computer components, DVD and Blu-Ray

Don't worry if you're unable to make $10 in a month then the total earning will be carried to the next month. They usually pays all affiliate sales earning at net 60 days. If your earning reaches the threshold by the end of March then you will be get paid in late May.

## **[ShareASale](https://account.shareasale.com/newsignup.cfm?)** (Approval Needed)

**Note:** ShareASale consider many factor before approving the site and one of them is traffic. If your blog or website isn't generating enough traffic then it might reject your approval.

ShareASale is another amazing affiliate program out there who pays on time and pays actually better. They have lot of merchants and you may find merchants relevant to your niche easily.

They have all types of Affiliate Marketing programs like **Pay-Per-Sale, Pay-Per-Click, & Pay-Per-Lead.** Similarly, they have merchants in all niches and some of them are **Home & Garden** merchants, **Fashion** merchants, **Green** merchants & **Business** merchants.

## **ClickBank** (Instant Approval)

It's almost similar to that of ShareASale. However, they also have vendors selling digital products like e-books, softwares, themes, memberships, etc. Affiliates are given with Clickbank referral link called HopLink which directs the traffic to the vendor's site.

If a customer purchases the product after being redirected using that Hoplink then they are paid a commission that is percentage of the sale which is directly credited to their clickbank account right away.

Clickbank features amazing tracking features and they pay on time. They have tons of categories to choose from and also you get **As Seen On TV** products too.

With Clickbank, you just need to prepare the content in order to promote the product. You can do that easily with blog by linking in between of content and redirect them to the merchant page. Once, they are there then every merchant have beautifully crafted pages with each and every detail of the product well explained therefore, it is much likely that your reader will make a sale.

**Let's talk about their commission structure.**

For vendors, there is a one-time fee for joining that is $45.95 while there is no fee for affiliates. Therefore, Clickbank attracts many affiliates and therefore so does vendors. It's a win-win situation.

The [Clickbank support page](https://support.clickbank.com/hc/en-us/articles/220365887-Earning-Commissions-Getting-Paid) tells about the commission and it's calculation.

Every ClickBank product has a commission rate that is set by the vendor, ranging from **1% to 75%.** When you drive a sale to that product, ClickBank processes the sale, applies its charges, then calculates the commission rate based on the remaining net sale amount. Here's an example of how much you'll earn on a one-time purchase product with a 55% commission rate:

Retail Price: $29.95

Subtract 7.5% + $1: -$3.25

Net Sale Amount: $26.70

55% of Remainder: $14.69

Therefore, as the referring affiliate for this sale, you would earn **$14.69**.

Recurring products can have different commission rates for the initial purchase and the rebill purchases, but the calculation is performed in the same way.

The maximum commission you can earn on a single sale is **$150.**

Now coming to getting paid by Clickbank, there are plenty of payment methods. Clickbank also have a payment threshold which is to be set by you within **$10 to $1,000,000**. By Default, it is set to $100 and if you want to withdraw money early then you can set it to minimum amount that is $10.

Clickbank offers the following payment methods,

- Check
