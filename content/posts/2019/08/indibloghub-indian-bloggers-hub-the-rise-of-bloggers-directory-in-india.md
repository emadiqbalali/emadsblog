Almost 200 posts completed on this blog, I'm feeling like I completed the milestone. I wasn't lucky enough to find **IndiblogHub** sooner. I found it when I was planning the keywords for my 183rd post on this blog.

IndiBlogHub is a social networking site for blogs. This is a place on the internet where blogs hang with other blogs. In short, it's main aim is to connect all the bloggers from India to showcase their blogs and get an medium to build audience. The approach of this site in unique and I was impressed when I found it for the first time.

As, I was browsing through one of the Blog's Facebook group and I found out the interview of a blogger hosted on IndiBlogHub. Being a curious teenager, I went ahead to check out the interview and this is when I found out this [platform 3/4](https://www.harrypotterplatform934.com/pages/about-platform-934) which is a [Indian Blog Directory](https://indibloghub.com).

Upon going through this platform, I was flabbergasted to see the community of bloggers roaming around this site sharing posts, interacting with each other and plenty of things happening like
