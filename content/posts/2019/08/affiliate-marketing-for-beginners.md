Many of you will definitely choose to make a website on a particular niche and then start affiliate marketing. Let's see how we can make one easily and without zero hassles.

## Making A Website For Affiliate Marketing

Nowadays making a website is not a big deal. Everyone with a little knowledge of using a computer can easily make one. Thanks to the **inbuilt website builder** that comes with hosting and domain packages.

Also, installing WordPress and then creating a site with some page builder like **Elementor, WP Beaver Page Builder, Brizy, etc.**

The Astra Starter Site is pretty much amazing as it allows you to import the whole site template as yours and edit it. This is amazing.

1. Plan and research the niche you are planning for.
2. Gather keywords and it's volume. Make a list of posts title and keep it ready.
3. Make a sheet and plan for publishing 1-3 posts every week.
4. Brainstorm some domain names related to niche and it should contain the main **keyword.**
5. Finally, search for that domain. I recommend either **GoDaddy or Hostinger.**
6. However, upon choosing **Hostinger Premium Hosting Plan** which is just Rs199/mo or $2.15/mo. It offers **Unlimited Websites Hosting, Free Domain** & **24/7 Support.** They have website builder free with this plan as well. But if you want WordPress then they also have a 1-Click installer which helps you install WordPress in 1 click.
7. Setup themes and necessary plugins. Check the recommended [plugins for Affiliate Marketing](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/10-best-affiliate-marketing-tools-and-plugins-for-wordpress/) here.
8. Get ready to post on your website along with affiliate links.
9. Make sure the content is excellent.

## Monetizing Website Apart From Affiliate Marketing

When you monetize your site with an affiliate program, it is not necessary to avoid all other types of monetizing methods. You can still apply for most used Monetizing methods for websites with content.

- [Google Adsense](https://adsense.com) ([Here's How You Can Get Approved Quickly](https://sastaeinstein.com/get-website-approved-adsense.html))
- PropellerAds (Best one & Highest Paying after Adsense)
- [More Ad Networks](https://sastaeinstein.com/top-highest-paying-affiliate-networks-you-should-sign-up-now-to-earn-money-online.html)

These above methods are the most used for monetizing blogs and websites. In this monetizing method, the ad networks display advertisements on your website which you can place manually with other ad networks while Google Adsense features Auto Placement of Ads.

Therefore, for the ads placed on your website, you're paid on impressions as well as clicks or say engagements.

## How Can I Earn Up To $500 A Month And Become A Successful Affiliate Marketer?

It takes time and consistency and requires smart moves. It all depends on your niche and the traffic you generate. Here are some tips you should be keeping in mind to start earning faster with affiliate marketing. I suggest you start a site or blog on affiliate marketing with Amazon by making a niche site.

- Don't listen to your brain or heart. Choose niche and keywords only after researching on it. It's not like, this product looks cool so, I'll promote it. No, this is not how it works.
- Focus on one niche and one itself. The whole site should be on one niche to get faster results.
- You should target keywords and optimize SEO along with posting consistently to get rank into Google or Search Engines faster so you get traffic for particular keywords you're targeting.
- There will be a lot of work for you to do. Staying organised is one of the keys to be a successful affiliate marketer. Make a plan in the sheet as I mentioned or use Editorial calendar to plan everything out.
- Manage affiliate links with plugins as mentioned above.
