Disclaimer: This review is not sponsored in anyway. I personally bought them and is reviewing for you to decide the best wireless earbuds out there. Thanks!

Did you just upgraded to a smartphone which no longer supports 3.5mm jack? I feel you, the next thing on your buying list will be the best wireless headphones out there in the market.

You go on Amazon, Google or whatever you wish to search and all headphones seems to be the best out there. All companies of respective headphones brags about being so good, but what actually is good?

In this article, I'm reviewing the realme wireless buds after using them for straight 2 weeks now.

After spending many hours researching on the headphones I'm finally here with this earbuds which definitely deserve to be reviewed.

I spent a lot on some headphones out there like [Noise Shots Sports - A TWS Headphone](https://sastaeinstein.com/gonoise-noise-shots-sport-honest-review/) & Saxo By Mivi (Over Ear Headphones) (I'll review it soon).

The money was worth it when I went for this **realme wireless earbuds**.

## Is realme Wireless Earbuds Worth It?

A quick paragraph on the company as many of you might be not very aware of this brand but they surely have some great phones now. They are into accessories as well including this earbuds.

**realme** was a subbrand of **OPPO** until it's separation in 2018. It is now a brand under a parent company of OPPO, i.e, [BBK Electronics](https://sastaeinstein.com/oppo-vs-vivo-vs-oneplus-the-secret-you-should-know-about-this-companies/) which is also a parent company of Vivo & OnePlus. 

Check for yourself, if it is worth it.

## Why You Should Buy Realme Wireless Earbuds?

The first time I took them in hands, I felt premium and flexible collar band. The wires are rigid and very durable. If you're not a rough user, this headphone can last more than a year. 

The moment I put them in the ears, I could listen the vocals perfectly with slightly good amount of bass in the background. I could also listen to all tunes in the instrument clearly.

The realme wireless earbuds is also good in noise cancellation. Indoor, I couldn't hear any background noise. It sealed down the background noise completely while outdoor I could listen to the background noise. However, the overall noise cancellation is perfect in this price segment.

**The mic picks the perfect voice, the sound is HD just like your smartphone microphone. Even while riding, I could hear the sound perfectly from this earbuds mic.**
