## Things You Need To Know Before Starting A Blog In India

As said, this is going to be a pretty neat guide. There will be no distractions at all. I'll clear one thing out before proceeding with this guide. I picked up the easiest thing for you to keep all the hassles aside and to get started without any worries.

There are lot of bloggers out there with lot of opinions about hosting and buying domains. There will be tons of bloggers recommending you out variety of hosting providers to go with. 

Now, everyone has their own taste and I agree many bloggers prefer the best when it comes to hosting. I will be teaching you how to start blogging in India in the easiest way possible.

**As of now, you're a beginner you'll have to find something more reliable and also it has to be not so pricey.** Being in India, spending in dollars were never my option and neither yours especially when you're a beginner and also a student looking to blogging in India.

If you're not one of the beginner and looking for a very reliable hosting provider then without hesitation from my side, it is [BlueHost](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/bluehost "BlueHost"). I totally recommend this hosting, if your blog/website is totally business to you and you rely on it for half or full of your income.

In this guide, I'll be using my own hosting that is this website is currently hosted on. Read further to know why I'm recommending it.

## Choosing Your Hosting Server

Well, the typical replies might be whoa, it is the best out there and all such selling intent. To be honest with you as much I can, I will elaborate on it. I'm not here to sell you hosting, I am here to teach you to start a blog and it should be working smoothly and hence in the process you need a good hosting. 

[**Hostinger**](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/hostinger "hostinger") is a good option for starting out and I know that because I'm using them. Don't believe me? [Checkout yourself.](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/#search=emadsblog.com)

Here's why it is a good option,

1. **Very User Friendly**. Managing hosting, and learning new terms in hosting is little bit of tougher side. However, the Hostinger Panel is very user friendly and I can say that after being with a lot of other Hosting providers.
2. **They are premium and in market for over 15 years now**. Their support has always been helpful to me even in migrating my site for free. It's better to fall for them at same price, you'll be paying to some Indian based companies, reselling hosting with terrible hosting that goes down at least 3-4 times a week.
3. Their **Speed & Performance** is also far better than many hosting provider. Although not top notch but it's more than fair. I love their custom developed Control Panel, hPanel.
4. Get their support live chat within 2 minutes. All I do is ping them whenever I want and they are there.

Hope you now understand why I am choosing Hostinger! If you want answer in short, then I'm going for it because it is easy to use and can help you getting your site live in under 2-3 hours apart from this they are premium and reliable.

## How To Start A Blog In India?

Let's get this straight forward now. It's time to get your own website/blog today. Get yourself a cup of coffee and follow this guide. At the end of article, my aim is that you should be having a WordPress blog that is ready to be designed your way and start blogging.

This is very beginning of creating a website or blog. All of us hesitate while doing this very beginning step that is to start a blog in India.

If you’re serious about blogging or creating a website all by yourself and learning it then you shouldn’t be hesitating by now.

You’ll be amazed at yourself after making one for yourself by spending some small amount of money. Here’s the estimation of the whatever the headline says, just in case!

Normally, Domain + Hosting costs you ₹2900 per year!

With My Discount Links, you get crazy cheap deal!

**Basic Plan Costs You:**

Domain (1 Year Free) + Hosting Single (4 Years) =  ₹**2350**

**Premium Plan Costs You (Recommended + I Use This)**

Domain (1 Year) + Hosting Unlimited Sites (4 Years) = **₹6,192**

After 1 year, you have to pay for domain only that is ₹489/year.

_\*Hostinger premium plan renews at ₹358/mo after 4 years! You can host unlimited websites on this plan. An amazing deal._
