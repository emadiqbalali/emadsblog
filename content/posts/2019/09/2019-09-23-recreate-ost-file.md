If users with Microsoft Outlook are unable to keep their present OST files, they will need to restart or **recreate their OST files if they are unable to restore the original database**.

By downloading a copy of Exchange mailbox products, you can recreate OST files again. .

Also known as the **Offline Storage Table file**, Outlook creates the OST file to store Exchange server copies of emails.

In this manner, if for some reason customers are unable to link to the Internet, they can continue to work in cache mode on their mailboxes.

When the Internet connection resumes, the mail server synchronizes the OST file and uploads the modifications.
