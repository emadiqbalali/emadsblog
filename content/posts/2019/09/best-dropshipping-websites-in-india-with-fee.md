Are you committed to start your own business of dropshipping? I know where exactly you'll stuck while planning for making a brand new E-Commerce website. Yes, that's it. 

**Finding Suppliers For Your Brand New E-Commerce Dropshipping Site.**

You will be almost done by planning everything but stuck at choosing Dropshipping website based in India.

I know people who do dropshipping in India is all targeting group of people from either United States, UK and Canada with their site filled with products from **Ali Baba, Oberlo, China Brands, etc.**

In this post, we are not going to talk about them as you're going to target people living in India and those suppliers for dropshipping in India is no chance.

Why?

- Product getting delivered to India takes about 15 days to a month. Nowadays, who waits that much for their products to reach. Let aside pre-ordering an iPhone 11 Pro Max! 
- There is sometime custom charged on the product when it arrives in India at port. This has to be paid by customer. You'll most likely lose that customer.

So, we will use Indian Based Dropshipping Websites to sign up for their plans and start drop shipping with them as they are local and delivers throughout India. 

Don't get confused. Targeting India don't give out profits are said by someone who can't target people effectively using Facebook Ads.

**Neil Patel** covers the [beginner guide to run Facebook ads that converts](https://neilpatel.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-running-facebook-ads-that-convert/) in just simple 7 steps! He covers everything in that article. Generating leads, Targeting on basis on users interest and much more. 

## Indian Dropshipping Websites With Their Fee

Before getting started, I wanted to know you that these websites sell their plans for a minimal fee. While starting, you can try out their lowest plan and then scale accordingly.

**The only thing why they charge is that,** they do hard work in maintaining the inventory and shipping out the product via your brand name. Also, maintain only the products that are hot and trending so that you can sell easily for your own profit and theirs as well.

If you're serious about starting out the dropshipping website, then I highly suggest to chose from these three companies. I tried all of them and they are definitely trusted and there are no signs of scams. They are registered as resellers in India. You can check out their websites for more information.

Being in India, people are way to skeptical about starting this business most likely because of "**What Society Will Think?"**. 

Hence, not way too competition here and if you're the one who believes "FSociety" then this is for you. You can rock it due to much advantages offered by this Dropshipping Website and lower competition. Also, targeting will be lesser as you will targeting female audiences.

Although, they claim one-time fee first and then renews it every year now before it was few months.
