## Detailed review of Bluehost

Today, I'm going to review Bluehost hosting. If you're unsure which hosting to go for, then I'm here going into the details of each and everything to help you make the perfect decision for hosting your website.

**Bluehost,** I recommend to all people planning to start their brand new website using WordPress. It's all because WordPress needs 3 things to be able process smoothly i.e, **Speed, Flexibility, & Support.**

Bluehost provides all those 3 things in their hosting. They are exceptionally faster, their support is just amazing like top notch from other providers and flexibility is well more than enough.

**Let's have a quick look at Pros & Cons of Bluehost Hosting.**

### Pros

- Recommended by WordPress.org
- 24/7 & 365 Days Expert Support
- Comes with full set of tools
- Minimalistic & User Friendly Dashhboard
- High Standard Built-In security
- SSD Servers (Faster Webpages) & Free Domain
- E-Commerce Features (Carts & SSL)

### Cons

- A little pricy but much less for what's offered
- Jumps in renewal prices
- No Windows Hosting Offered
- No Free Site Migration

If you're being honest with the Bluehost, then the above Pros & Cons are real. If you've no worries with the cons then you can easily get this hosting from Bluehost.

Let me tell you my story,

When I started blogging, I never knew about Hosting. I didn't knew how hosting works and how to select one. I randomly searched for some cheap local hosting provider from India and later realized as I expand my blog.

**What Happened?**

- My blog goes down at least straight 5 times in just a week.
- I get downtime even only crawlers were crawling my site. I received dozen of notification from Yandex crawlers that my site is super slow.
- I lost my whole money as they provided only 30 days money back guarantee but that time my blog was new and it doesn't have much content and it worked perfectly.
- Processing power was weak, CPU usage was very limited.
- **Even when migrating, I have to delete many things to reduce my whole database size in order to clone the database and migrate to another hosting provider. (This is real thing why you shouldn't as a beginner ever go for cheap hosting)**

## Do You Use Bluehost Now?

Yes, I do but not on this blog. I proudly host this blog on my second favorite hosting provider **"****[Hostinger](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/hostinger "hostinger")".** 

I happily use Bluehost on my two other blogs and a E-Commerce blog. Bluehost provides much better processing power than hostinger and their support never disappoints me. They helped me several incidents that occured to one of my websites I migrated to bluehost.

**As Bluehost doesn't provide Free Migration, you need to do it yourself.** 

**Therefore, if you're starting out then it's an amazing deal to join Bluehost for starting your blog or website.**

If you signup for **Bluehost** and get their any of the one plans, you get the following:

- **Free SSL**
- 30 Days Money Back Guarantee
- Marketing Services
- Free Paid Ads Credits (Adwords & Bing)
- Free SEO Tools
