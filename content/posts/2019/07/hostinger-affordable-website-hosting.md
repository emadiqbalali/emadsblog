## Why Hostinger Hosting?

In my personal opinion, this company is one of the best in terms of providing hosting at most amazing prices even the first time purchase and renewal as well.

[SiteGround](https://sastaeinstein.com/go/siteground) is considered the best and I am definitely not arguing on this, but being a beginner blogger you never need it. This hostinger provider attracts the new bloggers with it's initial pricing and when this new bloggers realizes it only when it's too late. Next year they move to affordable hosting which is very time consuming process to change hosts.

**Hostinger** is definitely the best and affordable website hosting because it is perfect in the terms of performance, storage, emails, SSL, free domain, etc. whatever you name it, they have it. To be honest, I am not a fan of the old and confusing layout of cPanel, and guess what?

Hostinger solved this issue out. They made a new and clean user interface for their control panel which goes by the name "hPanel". I love it.

## Advanced User?

Do you need a more powerful performance? Hostinger Hosting is definitely a good buy for being affordable but it does have other enhanced performance hosting as well such as,

- [Shared Hosting](https://www.hostg.xyz/SH4Cn)
- [Cloud Hosting](https://www.hostg.xyz/SH40I)
- WordPress Managed Hosting
- [VPS Hosting](https://www.hostg.xyz/SH40I)

## Conclusion

I hope you are convinced with this hostinger hosting review and I am not making you buy it but giving you good advice since I have been in the blogging field for over 4 years now and know the nuts and bolt of each and every hosting company out there. I also know there are small companies just reselling you the hosting with everything capped and making your experience of blogging a nightmare.

Trust me, I have already been there and not necessarily you should also fall in the trap of those "Very Cheap Hosting". The hostinger is already the affordable website hosting you can get hands-on.
