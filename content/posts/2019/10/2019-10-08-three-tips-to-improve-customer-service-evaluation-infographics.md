When considering improving customer service evaluation, try the following steps:

1. Measure customer satisfaction with a questionnaire. Only after knowing what the customer thinks can take the appropriate action.
2. Share feedback with relevant colleagues to share assumptions about the customer experience.

**Here are some customer service tips that can help you change the way you think about customer service and improve your satisfaction score**.

A particularly common occurrence when the company is busy is the thinning of customers and the focus on issues. In other words, the customer's face disappears and customer service representatives focus on the problem.

If that happens, customers will unfortunately not be able to receive the service they should have. You are thrown into the queue and you can mark the problem is “solved” or “follow up” as you move forward little by little.

To change the customer service approach from problem-centric to person-centric, train the team to think individually about each customer. Here is a checklist for staff to review.

**What did the customer say?**

1. **How have your customers had a relationship with your company so far?**
2. **There may be past problems behind the customer's current complaints.**
3. **What does the customer want to solve by contacting the company?**

When you think about every customer and provide services with the feeling of helping a friend, the whole approach changes, and the customer notices the change.

Customers will feel that they are treated as human beings and not as perceived as problems and that the company is reaching out.

In the ever-connected digital age, few customers bring problems only to call centers. It's common to visit websites, visit social media pages, and use digital devices to find solutions.

As a result, the customer service approach must be consistent across all customer contacts. Website layout, online agents, social media page is, corresponding to the customer's problem must be made that.

The important thing is to make the customer experience seamless at any point of contact so that whether you visit a website, make a call, or tweet to your company's Twitter account, the problem should be treated in the same approach. I must. Depending on where you are in contact, it may be difficult to get the illusion of talking to another company.

If you have staff responsible for responding to emails, responding via social media, responding to questions on the bulletin board, etc.they will have the same quality customer service training as store / individual staff and telephone staff Please be able to receive.

It is important to hone the [skills](https://www.mastercardbiz.com/2013/06/10/6-skills-every-small-business-manager-needs-to-succeed/) of all teams so that customers have an equally pleasant experience no matter what means they contact.

Unsatisfied customers can tell you as much about customer service as they do. Be sure to listen to customer complaints and provide an easy way to bring complaints to the company. 

No matter how good customer service technology is, it won't make sense unless customers find it. Frequently use customer satisfaction surveys and follow-up surveys. Even dissatisfied customers should be less dissatisfied if they contact the company and the problem is solved quickly.
