**We do not change it very often, but what if we have picked the wrong TV at the time purchase?**

It is very costly to buy a brand new TV and all the money would go waste if you pick the wrong choice for you. Don't worry, we have spent hours finding all the factors which one must consider before buying a Brand-New LED TV.

Our team has covered everything from size to screen color to smart TV needs, etc. You just go through this and you will be ready to make a perfect decision about purchasing the LED TV. 

Without wasting any time let’s take a look at some factors now.

## Things to Consider Before Buying LED TV

![buying led tv](images/image-000-1024x256.png)

The biggest factor that comes to mind while purchasing a new LED TV is the screen size of the TV. 

Users must consider how big the family is, compared to the size of the room in which they are going to place the TV. After that the location where the TV would go.

After considering all this choose the biggest TV size that is suitable for all these factors and according to your budget as well. The ideal size for LED TV in a normal size room is 32 inches. It is the size which most people go with. 

After 32-inch people have options of 40 to 75 or more inches, but all that depends on the size of the room and location of the TV. For smaller rooms, there is also an option of 24-inch available. 

But with a smaller size, you may have to suffer some features of TV as well. Some companies are unable to put all the latest features in a smaller size of LED TVs.

## Screen Resolution: 8K, 4K or FHD?

![4k vs 8k LED TV Buying](images/image-001.png)

For a long period, we have heard and seen the standard resolution of 1920 x 1080 which is full HD.

Resolution is the number of pixels that forms the picture on your LED TV screen horizontally and vertically. In simple words more the pixels, more the picture would be sharp and clear. 

Now all the companies are moving towards the 3840 x 2160 pixels which are Ultra HD or 4K. The overall experience of this resolution is, it provides more detailed and sharp picture quality which makes the TV experience more enhanced. 

Some companies have also launched their 8K resolution TVs but purchasing 8K resolution at this time is very early. No doubt the picture quality of this resolution is the best till now, but the content of this resolution is very limited so the option for a resolution to look on a TV is 4K. 

4K resolution is also perfect for gamers and users who love to watch animated or action movies that have a lot of details in them. 

## Refresh Rate

The refresh rate is the rate at which a TV refreshes the picture behind the screen. The video we watch on the TV screen is not a video, it is a combination of pictures which refreshes at a certain speed and looks like a video. 

The more the refresh rate the better, it is the only thing for the smooth and clear video quality. IF you have the bigger screen but a low refresh rate, your TV experience will suffer. 

The normal refresh rate is 60Hz which is suitable for almost all of the people. Unless you are doing some high-end work on you Smart TV or watching highly animated, or big games which requires more refresh rate. 

If one likes to play games on PlayStation or watch highly edited Hollywood movies than it must go for 60+ Hz in refresh rate.

## Smart or Non-Smart LED TV

Users can even install apps like Netflix, Hotstar, Voot, etc. It is all possible because of Smart LED TVs, they use the interface like our mobile devices use which allows us to use all these features.

The TV experience is not complete without the proper sound in it. Must check if the LED TV you are purchasing has a Dolby Sound System then you are good to go with that option. 

Otherwise, the sound will not be up to your expectation and in the long run, there are more chances of getting a distorted sound. 

All the branded and famous companies use the only Dolby sound system, it is one the best sound system that you can have in an LED TV.

## Brand of LED TV

Choosing the perfect brand is not only about the name and company of LED TV. It is also about the add-ons that you are getting by choosing that brand over all others. User must go with the brand like Samsung, Sony, LG is budget is not the issue. 

The least number of complaints are seen in these brands, these are the best brands of LED TV. But they are costly as compared to other brands.
