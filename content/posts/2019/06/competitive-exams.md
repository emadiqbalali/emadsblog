Cracking into these competitive exams need a whole lot of precise and accurate practice over time. Many students do it, they involve in practicing a lot in a dedicated and sincere manner however, they tend to ignore their weak spots and while some don't get to know their weak spots. Remember, why I listed the above coaching institutes? For those who aren't able to analyse their weaknesses these coaching centres will help you to do it.

The trick here is to recall and revise the weak spots from time to time and especially at the last moment. Doing so will make you more confident and helps you in cracking the exams.

### #2 **Avoid Heavy Preparations At The Last Moment**

I agree that at the last moment, you always feels lighter and are nervous that you are not enough prepared but that's the human instinct. Overcome it and never do the heavy preparations at the last moment. It only does the worse and nothing else. It will mixed up everything and makes a mess along with lot of stress in you. That is not something you need when you're going to attempt the exams.

### #3 **Managing Stress Throughout The Preparation**

Yes, it is obvious to get stressed while you're preparing for something. That is human's nature. You should instead learn to manage stress I'm not saying to not get stressed at all but you should be able to maintain the stress that is in the middle. Everyone have different thresholds and one should know about their and be able to maintain it. This will help you in staying confident and create motivation to do well.

### #4 **Relaxing Is Necessary**

Working hard is understood but compromising your health to work hard is not how you do it. When you don't relax enough, your brain runs out of fuel. You're creating a panic situation here. Relaxing is a way to fuel yourself up and stay healthy. In this way, you'll be able to work hard. You should take multiple breaks in between. It will help you to learn effectively and keep you fresh throughout the study period.

Hope you like the tricks, make sure you follow them. You'll surely be able to crack the competitive exams right away.
