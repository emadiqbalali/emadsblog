## Building A Gaming PC

![Budget Gaming PC under Rs 30000](images/computer-keyboard-connection-contemporary-1714208-1024x683.jpg)

Building a gaming PC all by yourself isn't that hard. You can always hop on to YouTube to watch and learn then build the stuff.

**However, in this article,** I'm not going to share the whole DIY guide to build a Gaming PC but I will be sharing with you the essential parts you should buy and gather to build the PC. It minuses your hassle in selecting the right part for your PC and you can focus on building it.

## MotherBoard/MainBoard:

Choosing a motherboard can be tricky. It should be compatible with the rest of the specification you are going to opt for. Clearly, in this article, I'll be listing all the parts compatible with each other.

**MSI 7A36-005R A32M Motherboard**

[![](//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B072633KTS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=IN&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=emadsblog-21&language=en_IN)](https://www.amazon.in/MSI-7A36-005R-A32M-Motherboard/dp/B072633KTS/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=3VKH2EQ853CN&keywords=am4+motherboards&qid=1559515580&s=computers&sprefix=am4+mo,computers,866&sr=1-6&linkCode=li3&tag=emadsblog-21&linkId=29964e2246a16c90b34604f8b42ecbaa&language=en_IN)![](https://ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=emadsblog-21&language=en_IN&l=li3&o=31&a=B072633KTS)

As our budget remains, Rs 30,000 to be exact therefore we need to cut down the list of all motherboard and opt for the best one in the market although that falls in the budget.

MSI 7A36 tops our list and most probably supports the later requirements with ease.

## Processor/CPU

This is the heart of the PC. If you're a gamer, you should have already heard of FPS (Frame Rate Per Second). The processor has the main role in giving those smooth FPS while playing graphics intensive games like Fortnite, PUBG, & CS: Go.

We decided to go for **AMD** and it is the best performer than **Intel** of course. We went for this which is pretty much clean and better performer yet follows our budget.

**AMD Ryzen 3 YD220 \[3.7 GHz\]**

## RAM

Now, RAM is again a crucial part of the PC. The more the ram, the more processes in the background can be run. When it comes to gaming, a whole lot of RAM especially in GB's are consumed and if you don't have enough RAM then it might drop the performance of your PC. Therefore, we went for Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400MHz RAM.

**Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400MHz**

## Graphics Card/GPU

We need something with the amazing CPU and we thought the GeForce GT 710 is almost a better combination in this budget Gaming PC to run any game smoothest.

With this card, we can almost run every game with slight setting tweaks and even the modest games run perfectly on higher or medium settings.

## HDD/SSD

Storage is an essential thing when it comes to Gaming PC as the games on PC aren't 1 or 2GB and it goes like up to 50GB for some games and that too it will be the installation file only.

Therefore, we need storage for such installation files and other things like movies and pictures on Hard Disk Drive while essential programs and Windows OS files, and games run on the Solid State Drive for smooth and faster performance.

## DVD Drive (Optional)

In this modern world, we couldn't find a reason why one would buy a DVD or even store their backup in a DVD. Anyway, having a DVD drive on your PC is a great idea. Sometimes, not everyone are equipped with bootable USB drives to install windows on your brand new PC. If you know about bootable flash drives then skip the DVD.

**You can find it on Amazon pretty easily. If you want,** [check it out.](https://www.amazon.in/LG-24x-Internal-Writer-Black/dp/B016MMCJL2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=lg+dvd&qid=1559603304&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
