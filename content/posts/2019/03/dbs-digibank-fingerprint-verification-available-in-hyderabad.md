## DigiBank DBS Biometric Verification Now In Hyderabad

As we know, DBS Bank operates its 12 branches across the country and Hyderabad doesn’t own any branches of DBS Bank, therefore, people in Hyderabad couldn’t apply or open an account in DBS Bank.

Recently, when they introduced DigiBank by DBS, everyone living in India was able to open an account with just Aadhar Card. No paperwork hassles and no visiting to branches, however, there are certain limits on transactions that can be done in a calendar year.

To overcome these limits, RBI mandates every such digital bank to do the Full KYC that is BioMetric Verification before the limits can be removed from their accounts.

As Hyderabad doesn’t have any braches, DigiBank by DBS doesn’t operate or provide KYC Centres which are Cafe Coffee Day in the case for DBS banks. Also, they don’t provide agents to do KYC at your doorsteps in Hyderabad.
