Plugins play an important role in every WordPress bloggers life. Plugins are almost considered masterpieces when it comes to customization of your WordPress Blog or Website. Here are 9 Wonderful WordPress Plugins.

Why?

Not all bloggers are tech savvy or coders who can go into the theme codes and edit the codes to their needs. The plugin does the job for them, apart from this job many plugins offer plenty of other benefits.

Plugins take care of **Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Redirections, Caching, Smushing Images**, etc.  

Also, do note that installing too many plugins can take up too many resources and CPU which eventually slows down the performance of your website and WordPress users might get irritated. It is mostly because many plugins are front-end and can add additional javascript and CSS which will require a lot of requests slowing it down.

**It is recommended to install not more 20 plugins**. However, you should install only the one you’re using and rest can be deactivated. If you want to know “[How Many Is Too Many?](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/too-many-plugins/)” then you can read that article. You don’t need to install all popular plugin.
