Starting off with the murder of one of the Blossom twins, Jason Blossom and Cheryl Blossom, who went for a pleasant boat ride in Sweetwater river, where Jason Blossom is shot and his body nowhere to be found.

The entire Riverdale town comes up with their own assumptions on how Jason was murdered, some even accusing his own blood sister.

The fact that this show gets more interesting, is due to the fact that Jason was trying to run away from his home with his pregnant girlfriend, Polly Cooper, Betty Cooper's sister, but they messed up badly and one ends up dead and the other one ends up in a home for troubled youths.

But the relation between Coopers and Blossoms wasn't started by Jason and Polly, in fact, It was Great Grandpa Cooper and Great Grandpa Blossom who started the town's famous Maple syrup industry, but the relationship ended badly when Great Grandpa Blossom murdered Great Grandpa Cooper.

“Why was Great Grandpa Cooper murdered?” “How come Jason and Polly's escape plan failed and who shot Jason and why was his body missing with her sister safe and sound?” These were some of the questions to which Archie and his gang try to find answers to.
