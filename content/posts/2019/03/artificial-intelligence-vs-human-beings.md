The popular cultures have tried to indistinct the image of Artificial Intelligence to the public.

The real or strong AI gets attention when a system can retrieve information from the outside world and learn it by itself to create a consciousness similar to that of humans.

Some of you might already hear about Artificial Intelligence while some of you don’t, the only thing about Artificial Intelligence is that it is under development. It is a fact that we are using Artificial Intelligence in our everyday lives.

Let’s say, for example, You are watching TV shows on Netflix and Netflix recommend you the shows you like to watch next. Netflix uses Artificial Intelligence in order to recommend films and TV Shows.

Not limited to shows, the incredible ability of Amazon to anticipate your next purchase uses AI and the voice assistants you’ve been using in your smartphones are using AI to understand your natural speech.

## **What Changes Can AI Bring To Human Lives In The Future?**

In the future, Artificial Intelligence will expand into support functions such as HR or supply chain optimization where logistics decision will be automated.

Apart from all this, AI allows you to combine an imperfect process of reducing scale with real information about the real effects reflected in extreme weather conditions, insurance claims, observed outbreak and arrival of migrants.

In particular, the use of this technology is based on processing and sharing of large amounts of data, generation, collection both individually and collectively.

Even Stephen Hawking commented on the question “[Whether AI can harm mankind or not](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540)?”. He commented, “The forms of Artificial Intelligence we already have are proven to be very useful.”

AI points to a future in which machines not only perform all physical tasks, as they have done since the industrial revolution but also plan, strategies and make decisions.

## **Drawbacks & Experts Opinion About AI**

Yet, Artificial Intelligence has a lot of advantages human can adopt and many see Artificial Intelligence as an increase in human capacity, but some predict the opposite because deepening dependence on machine-based networks will undermine their ability to think for themselves, act independently of automated systems and interact effectively with others.

Many people also believe that artificial intelligence might cost them their jobs in the future. To support this, there is a study by the [World Economic Forum in 2016](https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2016/sessions/the-state-of-artificial-intelligence), predicted that almost 5.1 million jobs will be lost to Artificial Intelligence just over the next 5 years, across 15 countries.

That’s an impressive amount, yet bad news for people out there and good thing to companies as AI will lead them to save thousands of salaries that is to be given if humans were doing those jobs.

However, keeping AI aside, there is another technology called “Automation” which can eliminate the need for manpower and eliminate the so-called Jobs.

If you want to read about this technology and where it is used, you can head to “[The 3 Technologies From The Future You Need To Know](https://sastaeinstein.com/2018/05/the-3-technologies-of-the-future-you-need-to-know.html)”.

Apart from this, there are some things which Artificial Intelligence may never be able to do therefore it cannot be considered everywhere like understanding the situation of ongoing disasters and interacting accordingly.

It is like they still need plenty of huge data to learn things from but they still can’t detect what’s going on and act according to it.

## **So, Is Artificial Intelligence going to change our lives in the future?**

Yes, experts say that if we use artificial intelligence in other cases like for “Avoiding Errors” which human does naturally but the computer doesn’t.

Also, it can adapt where the Faster decision is required to make on the basis of evaluation a large amount of data.

AI can also help in dealing with all boring tasks and make a man more creative.
