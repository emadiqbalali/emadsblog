Getting a shady brown skin or say tan is not an Indian thing. Ultimately, all Indian’s prefer fairer and smoother skin. India is pretty famous for its love for light skin.

Maybe, there are some who don’t love this but the majority of people do love having light skin.

I’m not in any way telling you about the ways to have light skin but to protect it from the sun which will make it tan or say dark.

Are you scared of sun or most probably getting tanned? Keep on reading, I got your back.

## **Is Getting Tanned Normal?**

There are a lot of people who think that getting tan is a pretty common thing and a healthy lifestyle. In fact, it is a myth. Sunburn clearly damages your immune system hence making you more likely to catch infectious illness or disease.

Apart from this, some of you might not get tanned or burns on your skin. **That’s really not the thing to be proud of**. It is just a sign that you’re causing permanent damage to your skin. Later on, you’ll be introduced to wrinkles, aging skin, and discoloration of course.

# **How I Should Protect Myself From Getting Tanned?**

Many of you have already thought about it already. Protection from tan usually means using Sunscreen. Well, yes it is but Sunscreen doesn’t protect you on its own because it can’t block all the UV radiation sun produces.

Ever heard about SPF 15, 30 & 50 on your sunscreen? It’s nothing but a factor which indicates the level of UVB rays it can block. Let’s see how much each of them can block the radiations.

- **The SPF 15** - Blocks 93% UVB Rays
- **While SPF 30** - Blocks 97% UVB Rays
- **Similarly SPF 50** - Blocks 98% UVB Rays
- **And SPF 100** - Blocks 99% UVB Rays

Do you see that? None of the sunscreens protects you completely from the UV radiations. However, they work in block majority of rays and you should be spending a lot lesser time outside with sunscreen on.

You shouldn't be roaming outside super confident exposing to the sun for a longer time as it can lead to tanned skin.

If you’re unprotected and is exposed to the sun then it takes only a mere 15 minutes to turn your skin, red in color. However, when you use sunscreen you prevent reddening of skin [15 times longer](https://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/sunscreens-explained) theoretically.

Therefore, applying sunscreen gives you **4-5 hours of time to spend outside in the sun.**

> **Pro Tip**:
> 
> You should always allow 20-30 minutes for your skin to absorb and make a protective layer after applying sunscreen.

## **Top 3 Sunscreens You Should Buy**

These 3 sunscreens I’m recommending are personally tested. They are super comfortable on the skin and doesn’t burn my skin.

At the most, I spent less than 3 hours in the sun with these sunscreens on.

Lakme Sunscreen is my current favorite warrior of UV radiation. It is light on the skin and feels smooth. I didn’t have any skin issues after applying it. Since then I am a fan of Lakme especially this Ultra Matte Gel which doesn’t leave any residue and feels like you didn’t apply anything.

I’m not personally fond of Neutrogena products, but the sunscreen works as stated. It does protect me from the UV radiation, however, you can feel it on the skin. It is a little bit greasy and heavy on your skin. After giving a shot for the first time, I didn’t buy the product after that. Also, it contains [Paraben](https://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-looks/beauty/parabens/)**[.](https://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-looks/beauty/parabens/)**

Biotique Bio Sandalwood Sunscreen which I used when my Lakme sunscreen went out of stock. I ordered it because it says Ultra Soothing Face Lotion, and I thought when not to give it a try until the Lakme sunscreen gets in stock. I was amazed, it was impressive. It even worked when I was washed my face as it is water resistant. Most importantly for girls, it can be applied over the makeup. To be honest, I didn’t find it that light as Lakme does.

## **Bonus**

Almost all the article, **I talked about getting exposed to the sun also makes you get exposed to UV radiation too**. Right?

That’s not exactly how it sounds.

Even if the day is cloudy, or it’s winter with chilly morning still you’re exposed to UV radiations.

UV Radiations are not hot, as many think this way. They are just radiation, the heat you get is from the sun. The main source of UV rays is Sun.

It’s simple! When there is the sun, there are UV rays. **No matter if it is cold or cloudy**. This is the reason I use sunscreen throughout the year regardless of weather.

You can simply head to [SunburnMap](https://sunburnmap.com/) to know what’s the UV Index outside in your state. You can also check how much time you get to spend outside with SPF 30 sunscreen applied.
